I applied a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to a Bangla handwritten character dataset. The model includes:

✅ Convolutional layers

✅ ReLU activation

✅ MaxPooling layers

✅ Flatten layer

✅ Dense (fully connected) layers

Results include:

📊 Model architecture with full parameter list (all layer details)

📉 Loss and accuracy curves for both training and testing

🧮 Confusion matrix

🔍 ROC curve
